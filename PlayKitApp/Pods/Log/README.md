`Log` is a powerful logging framework that provides built-in themes and formatters, and a nice API to define your owns.

> Get the most out of `Log` by installing [`XcodeColors`](https://github.com/robbiehanson/XcodeColors) and [`KZLinkedConsole`](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/KZLinkedConsole)

### Usage

#### The basics

- Use `Log` just as you would use `print`.

```swift
let Log = Logger()

Log.trace("Called!!!")
Log.debug("Who is self:", self)
Log.info(some, objects, here)
Log.warning(one, two, three, separator: " - ")
Log.error(error, terminator: "ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±\n")
```

- Disable `Log` by setting `enabled` to `false`:

```swift
Log.enabled = false
```

- Define a minimum level of severity to only print the messages with a greater or equal severity:

```swift
Log.minLevel = .warning
```

> The severity levels are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warning`, and `error`.

#### Customization

- Create your own `Logger` by changing its `Theme` and/or `Formatter`.

A suggested way of doing it is by extending `Formatters` and `Themes`:

```swift
extension Formatters {
    static let detailed = Formatter("[%@] %@.%@:%@ %@: %@", [
        .date("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS"),
        .file(fullPath: false, fileExtension: false),
        .function,
        .line,
        .level,
        .message
    ])
}

extension Themes {
    static let tomorrowNight = Theme(
        trace:   "#C5C8C6",
        debug:   "#81A2BE",
        info:    "#B5BD68",
        warning: "#F0C674",
        error:   "#CC6666"
    )
}
```

```swift
let Log = Logger(formatter: .detailed, theme: .tomorrowNight)
```

> See the built-in [formatters](https://github.com/delba/Log/blob/master/Source/Extensions/Formatters.swift) and [themes](https://github.com/delba/Log/blob/master/Source/Extensions/Themes.swift) for more examples.

**Tip:** `Log.format` and `Log.colors` can be useful to visually debug your logger.

Nothing prevents you from creating as many loggers as you want!

```swift
let Basic = Logger(formatter: .default, theme: nil)
let Short = Logger(
    formatter: Formatter("%@: %@", .level, .message),
    theme:     .tomorrowNightEighties,
    minLevel:  .info
)
```

- Turn off the colors by setting the theme to `nil`:

```swift
Log.theme = nil
```

#### Advanced

Include a custom `Block` component in your formatter to print its result in every log message: 

```swift
struct User {
    static func token() -> Int {
        return NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults.integerForKey("token")
    }
}

Log.formatter = Formatter("[%@] %@: %@", .block(User.token), .level, .message)
```

## Installation

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Log into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "delba/Log"
```

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.

You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate Log into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
use_frameworks!

pod 'Log'
```
